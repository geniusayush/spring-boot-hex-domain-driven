This is my best case attempt at the test assingment 
#to run 
make docker to dockerize the app
docker-compose up to run the app 

- #scale your API gateway?
- since i use amazon api gateway it scales up automatically 

- #monitor uptime so you can sleep at night?
  aws cloudwatch can have a monitor and trigger integrations on slack 

dev environment is doecerize and uses spring boot

the api gateway can be secured by adding congnito to the solution
